# move the avi files created by the pi detector to a place from where they can be sent to the monitor server
# (moving the files to another place before sending them guarantees that you are not copying a file which is still 
# being written to
sudo mv /var/lib/motion/*.avi ~/monitor/avi/tosend/
#copy the files on the monitor server
cp ~/monitor/avi/tosend/* ~/temp/
#move the already copied files to an archive location
mv ~/monitor/avi/tosend/* ~/monitor/avi/sent/
